messages lab part 2.
I have correctly implemented all parts of this lab.
This lab took me about 30 minutes.
I did not receive any help on this lab.
It is possible to request data from a different origin, as seen in this lab. This is possible through alternatives like cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), which allows HEAD, GET, and POST request methods.
